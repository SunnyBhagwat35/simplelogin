Hi

Do you know you can send an email to anyone from your alias?
This below Youtube video walks you quickly through the steps:

Here are the steps:
1. First click "Contacts" on your alias you want to send email from
2. Enter your contact email, create a "reverse-alias"
3. Use this reverse-alias instead of your contact email when composing your email

And voil√†, your contact will receive this email sent from your alias!
Your real mailbox address will stay hidden.

Best regards,
