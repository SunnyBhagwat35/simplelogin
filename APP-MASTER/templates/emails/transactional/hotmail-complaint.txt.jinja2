Hi,

This is SimpleLogin team.

Hotmail has informed us about an email sent to {{ alias.email }} that might have been considered as spam,
either by you or by Hotmail spam filter.

Please note that explicitly marking a SimpleLogin's forwarded email as Spam affects SimpleLogin email delivery,
has a negative effect for all users and is a violation of our terms and condition.

If thatâ€™s the case, please disable the alias instead if you don't want to receive the emails sent to this alias.

If somehow Hotmail considers a forwarded email as Spam, it will help us if you can move the email out of the Spam folder.
You can also set up a filter to avoid this from happening in the future using this guide at https://simplelogin.io/help/

Looking to hear back from you.
