Hi,

This is SimpleLogin team.

Hotmail has informed us about an email sent to {{ user.email }} that might have been considered as spam,
either by you or by Hotmail.

Please note that explicitly marking a SimpleLogin's forwarded email as Spam
  affects SimpleLogin email delivery,
  has a negative effect for all users and is a violation of our terms and condition.

If somehow Hotmail considers a forwarded email as Spam, it helps us if you can move the email
  out of the Spam folder. You can also set up a filter to avoid this
  from happening in the future using this guide at
  https://simplelogin.io/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/

Please don't put our emails into the Spam folder. This can end up in your account being disabled on SimpleLogin.

Looking to hear back from you.
