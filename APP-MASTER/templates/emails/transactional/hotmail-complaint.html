    Hotmail has informed us about an email sent to <b>{{ alias.email }}</b> that might have been considered as spam,
    either by you or by Hotmail spam filter.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    Please note that explicitly marking a SimpleLogin's forwarded email as Spam affects SimpleLogin email delivery,
    has a negative effect for all users and
    is a violation of our terms and condition.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    If thatâ€™s the case, please disable the alias instead if you don't want to receive the emails sent to this alias.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    If somehow Hotmail considers a forwarded email as Spam, it will help us if you can move the email out of the Spam
    folder.
    You can also set up a filter to avoid this from happening in the future using this guide at
    https://simplelogin.io/help/
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    Looking to hear back from you.
  {% endcall %}

    Best, <br/>
    SimpleLogin Team.
