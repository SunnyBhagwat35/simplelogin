We have recorded an attempt to send the following email from your alias {{ alias }} from an unknown IP address {{ ip }}.

- From: {{alias}}

To prevent email-spoofing, SimpleLogin enforces the SPF (Sender Policy Framework).
Emails sent from an IP address that is unknown by your email service are refused by default.

However you can turn off this option by going to {{mailbox_url}}.

Please only turn this protection off this if you know what you're doing :).
