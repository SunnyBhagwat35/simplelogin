An email has been sent to the alias {{alias}} that would be created automatically as you own the directory {{directory}}.

As the directory has the on-the-fly alias creation disabled, the alias isn't created.

If you aren't aware of this alias, that probably means someone has discovered about your directory and is abusing it.
