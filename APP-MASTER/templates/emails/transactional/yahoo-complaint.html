    Yahoo has informed us about an email sent to <b>{{ alias.email }}</b> that might have been marked as spam.

  {% call text() %}
    Please note that explicitly marking a SimpleLogin's forwarded email as Spam affects SimpleLogin email delivery,
    has a negative effect for all users and
    is a violation of our terms and condition.

    If that’s the case, please disable the alias instead if you don't want to receive the emails sent to this alias.
