Hi

Our most requested feature is finally ready: you can now add several *real* email addresses into SimpleLogin
and choose which one to use when creating aliases!

A real email address is called *mailbox* in SimpleLogin.

This feature is particularly useful if you have several email addresses,
maybe for different uses: a Gmail account for social networks & forums, a Prontonmail account for professional emails, etc.

When creating an alias, you can choose which mailbox that *owns* this alias, meaning:

- emails sent to this alias are *forwarded* to the owning mailbox.

- the owning mailbox can *send* or reply emails from this alias.

You can also change the owning mailbox for an existing alias.

The mailbox doesn't have to be your personal email: you can also create aliases for your friend by adding his/her email as a mailbox.

As usual, let us know if you have any question by replying to this email.

Best regards,
SimpleLogin team.
