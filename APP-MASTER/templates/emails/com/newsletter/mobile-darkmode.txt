Hi

Son from SimpleLogin here. I hope you are doing well and are staying at home in this difficult time.
By the way I'm writing this newsletter from my couch with my cats proofreading the text :).

Here are some of our latest news:

1) Mobile apps

Now you can quickly create aliases on-the-go with SimpleLogin Android and iOS app, thanks to our mobile guy Thanh-Nhon!
Download:
- the Android app on Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.simplelogin.android
- the iOS app on App Store https://apps.apple.com/app/id1494359858

With the release of the mobile apps, SimpleLogin now covers most major platforms:

- Desktop with SimpleLogin web app or Chrome, Firefox and Safari extension
- Mobile with Android and iOS app

The apps code is of course open-source and available on our Github http://github.com/simple-login/

2) Dark mode

No worries, we are not going to the dark side :).
You have asked for it and now the dark mode is finally available, thanks to Dung - our full-stack guy.
You can finally enjoy using SimpleLogin in the dark.

3) Alias name, new UI, security page, new policy privacy

You might have noticed that the web UI is now more compact: the web app has undergone a remake
to make it more responsive for usual actions like enabling/disabling an alias, updating alias note, etc.

You can set a name for your alias: this name is used when you send emails or reply from your alias.

We have also created a new security page that goes into the technical details of SimpleLogin.
Our privacy page is also rewritten from scratch: nothing changes about your data protection
but the page is now much more clear and detailed now.

4) Facebook, Google, Github login deprecation

We have decided to deprecate those social login options because of several reasons:

- Privacy: every time you sign in using one of these methods, the respective company knows and
    we have no information on what they do with this data.
- Not fully open-standard compatible: these platforms enjoy their monopolies and
    don't play well with open standards like OAuth2/OpenID: in fact, implementations on mobile of these social login
    require their SDK that we refuse to add because of privacy concern.
- Uniform experiences for all users: to have these social login in our iOS app, we need to support "Sign in with Apple"
    that isn't broadly available for Android users. Again, another big tech enjoying its monopoly.

If you happen to use one of these social login options, please create a password for your account on the Setting page

You can still sign in using these social login until 2020-05-31. After this date, they will be removed.

5) WebAuthn (Beta)

Thanks to one of SimpleLogin users, the WebAuthn is now available in Beta.
Please reply to this email if you want to try this out.

We want to say thank you to all users who have helped to improve SimpleLogin code and even contribute important features.
That means a lot to us as SimpleLogin is after all an open-source project.

We always welcome your feedback. Get in touch on social media, where you can also follow all our latest updates.

Best regards,
Son.
